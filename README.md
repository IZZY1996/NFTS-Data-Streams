# NFTS Data Streams
This PowerShell Script can be used to find Alternate Data Streams (ADS) that are outside the normal expected types. This can be used for threat hunting or forensics on NTFS systems.

# About Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
All files on an NTFS volume consist of at least one stream - the main stream â€“ this is the normal, viewable file in which data is stored. The full name of a stream is of the form <filename>:<stream name>:<stream type> The default data stream has no name. That is, the fully qualified name for the default stream for a file called "sample.txt" is "sample.txt::$DATA" since "sample.txt" is the name of the file and "$DATA" is the stream type. <sub><sub><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/a82e9105-2405-4e37-b2c3-28c773902d85">Microsoft Docs | 5.1 NTFS Streams</a></sub></sub>
